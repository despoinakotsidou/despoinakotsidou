## Hey, my name is Despi 👋

I’ve been living in Vienna, Austria, for many years... 
👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently pursuing a master’s in Business Informatics. 
🖥️ I built websites focused on SEO and user experience.
📈 Overtime, my interest in data analysis has grown, and I’m now passionate about using tools like Tableau, Python, and SQL to help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

My goal is to empower companies to grow through data.
